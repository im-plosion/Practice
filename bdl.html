            <p class="first-paragraph">Alexander von Humboldt could be the first environmentalist, even in that moment there weren’t enough technological tools. Through their different journeys, he understood that everything is connected, we wrote “I must learn about harmony in nature”. Perhaps, he didn’t have enough time to explore the seas, but If he had explored the seas, he would confirm his theory: everything is connected and all life on Earth depends on this harmony. 
            </p>
            <p>In the oceans there is a huge biodiversity even when we don’t notice and we don´t think a lot about this. We associate biodiversity with the jungles or we think in the Amazonas, but the same complex ecosystems live in the water. We could compare the Coral Reef like the Marine Jungles, and this kind of paradise is losing and all the species that live there are dying and it is not affecting just the sea life but also the life on the land and the weather too.

            <h5>Return the harmony</h5>
            <hr>
            <p class="second-paragraph"> Returning the harmony of nature is the biggest challenge for all of us. Climate Change is the main reason for the biodiversity loss into the seas and over the Earth. The increases of the temperature modify dramatically from the little systems until the huge species. We need to develop more environmental strategies and policies against the major impacts that come from industries. If we could decrease Climate Change we could protect biodiversity in every ecosystem including Coral Reefs.
